Bones STF wheels outperform all other wheels, and because they wear so well, they last several times longer than normal wheels, making STF wheels the best for less. Bones STF wheels are available in the original STF 103A and the new STF 99A for greater roll, control and softer landings on rougher terrain. Shape: V2 Locks Formula: STF 99A. Tighter Profile & Straighter Edge for Better Lock-In Control. ",

    "info": "Our Cruiser Wheels were designed to be ideal for carving & cruising but also one heck of a freeride wheel! They measure 69mm in diameter, 78a in hardness & are sold in a set of 4 wheels. The high rebound urethane is well-suited to any type of riding. The square-lipped design grips when you need it but can still be pushed out for a smooth slide thanks to characteristics of the urethane itself. These wheels will leave fat thane lines but are surprisingly resilient. Each set weights roughly 1. 45 pounds. These 78a wheels have great grip for cornering & easily roll over cracks, small rocks, & rough surfaces. When sliding, they offer great control, slow you down rapidly, wear quickly, & leave thane lines. Ideal for cruising, carving, freeride & downhill. Cloud Ride pours quality urethane into every wheel they produce, manufactured to focus on durability with an amazing attention to detail. Leave your mark on the hill with some insane thane under your board & grab your next set of wheels from Cloud Ride.
